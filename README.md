# SpatialOS Unreal GDK Starter Project

You can use the SpatialOS Unreal GDK Starter Project as the basis for developing a game using the SpatialOS Unreal GDK. To use the Starter Project, you need to follow the [setup guide](https://github.com/improbable/UnrealGDK/blob/master/docs/setup-and-installing.md) for the SpatialOS Unreal GDK.

> Note that the SpatialOS Unreal GDK is currently in **pre-alpha**, and we arenâ€™t supporting any game development on it at this stage.

For more information, see the [SpatialOS Unreal GDK repository](https://github.com/improbable/UnrealGDK) and its [documentation](https://github.com/improbable/UnrealGDK/blob/master/docs/readme.md).
